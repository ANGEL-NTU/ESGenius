"83147","1129","Which of the following best explains why the guidance excludes disclosures on food safety, waste, and sourcing for entities in the Hotels & Lodging industry, as outlined in the IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance on Implementing Climate-related Disclosures – Volume 52: Hotels & Lodging?","A","Because the guidance presumes hotel and lodging entities do not provide food and beverage services as part of their operations.","Because these topics are universally irrelevant to all entities within the Hotels & Lodging industry.","Because the guidance assumes that such disclosures are covered under separate standards unrelated to climate-related risks.","Because food safety, waste, and sourcing are considered less material than energy and water management in this industry.","Not sure"
"83148","1130","Which of the following best explains why an entity must disclose all lodging facilities located in 100-year flood zones, irrespective of their geographic location, as outlined in the IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance on Implementing Climate-related Disclosures – Volume 52: Hotels & Lodging?","B","Because hotels in such zones are guaranteed to face operational disruptions due to flooding every year.","To provide a comprehensive assessment of potential financial risks associated with properties exposed to significant flood hazards globally.","To ensure compliance with insurance regulations that mandate disclosure for properties prone to any annual flooding risk greater than one percent.","Because disclosing these facilities helps entities avoid higher insurance premiums by identifying low-risk areas within flood zones.","Not sure"
"83149","1131","Which of the following best explains why an entity's calculation of total energy consumption would exclude energy not directly consumed by the entity during the reporting period, even if such energy was produced or purchased by the entity, as outlined in the IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance on Implementing Climate-related Disclosures – Volume 52: Hotels & Lodging?","C","Because only energy from renewable sources is relevant for sustainability reporting.","Because purchased electricity is indirectly responsible for all greenhouse gas emissions reported by the entity.","Because energy not directly consumed does not contribute to the entity’s greenhouse gas emissions or operating expenses during that period.","Because the higher heating values method cannot be applied to energy not directly consumed.","Not sure"
"83341","1132","Which scenario would require an entity to exclude a product's revenue from disclosure under TR-AP-410a.1 despite its potential to improve fuel efficiency or reduce emissions, as outlined in the IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance on Implementing Climate-related Disclosures – Volume 62: Auto Parts?","D","A product that achieves meaningful improvement in fuel efficiency by aligning with EU Directive 2012/27/EU but is sold exclusively for testing purposes.","A product that demonstrates incremental improvements in combustion efficiency, validated against the milestones in the European Commission’s Road Map to a Resource Efficient Europe.","A product that enhances aerodynamics and is certified as part of a state renewable portfolio standard.","A product that reduces nitrogen oxide emissions during its use phase but indirectly contributes to overall emission reductions through ancillary mechanisms.","Not sure"
"83342","1133","Which scenario would require an entity to account for a product's revenue only once under the described framework, as outlined in the IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance on Implementing Climate-related Disclosures – Volume 62: Auto Parts?","A","A product designed to both increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions through hybrid braking technologies.","A product that indirectly enhances fuel efficiency by being marginally lighter than its predecessor.","A product improving aerodynamics as part of a suite of features contributing to ancillary emission reductions.","A product focused exclusively on waste heat recovery without impacting emissions.","Not sure"
"83343","1134","Which statement accurately reflects the conditions under which revenue from products designed to increase fuel efficiency or reduce emissions must be disclosed, as outlined in the IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance on Implementing Climate-related Disclosures – Volume 62: Auto Parts?","B","Revenue is disclosed only if the product’s impact on fuel efficiency or emissions reduction aligns with milestones in Section 5 of the European Commission’s Road Map, regardless of whether improvements are incremental.","Revenue is reported for products that provide meaningful improvements in fuel efficiency or emission reductions, including those validated by testing, modeling, or alignment with recognized frameworks.","Products offering indirect or ancillary improvements to fuel efficiency are included in the disclosure scope if they demonstrate alignment with EU Directive 2012/27/EU.","All products slightly lighter than previous versions qualify for revenue disclosure as long as they contribute indirectly to reduced emissions.","Not sure"
"83406","1135","Which statement accurately reflects the implications of the text regarding the consolidation and disclosure of GHG emissions data, as outlined in the IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance on Implementing Climate-related Disclosures – Volume 66: Marine Transportation?","C","An entity may choose to consolidate GHG emissions data using an approach that aligns with its operational control rather than financial reporting data.","Entities are required to adjust their financial reporting data to match the organizational boundary defined by the CDSB Framework exclusively.","GHG emissions data must be consolidated in alignment with the financial control approach, even if alternative methods are used for other disclosures.","The Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) allows entities flexibility to define new organizational boundaries outside of the financial control approach.","Not sure"
"83407","1136","Which of the following best explains why marine transportation entities might prioritize investments in fuel-efficient engines despite already being among the most fuel-efficient modes of transportation, as outlined in the IFRS S2 Industry-based Guidance on Implementing Climate-related Disclosures – Volume 66: Marine Transportation?","D","The industry seeks to further reduce its already minimal greenhouse gas emissions per ton shipped to achieve carbon neutrality.","Entities are required by law to adopt cleaner-burning fuels regardless of their current fuel efficiency levels.","Heavy reliance on bunker fuel has made the industry immune to regulatory pressures, prompting voluntary upgrades for competitive advantage.","Fuel costs represent a significant operational expense, and improving efficiency offsets rising prices while complying with stricter environmental regulations.","Not sure"
